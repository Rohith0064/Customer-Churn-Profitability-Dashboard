## üó£Ô∏è How to Present This Project in Interviews

> ‚ÄúI developed a customer churn and profitability analysis dashboard for a subscription business using Power BI. I cleaned and preprocessed the data in Python, calculated advanced metrics using DAX, and visualized key business KPIs like churn risk, CLTV, and demographic profitability. This helped surface actionable insights such as high-risk customer groups and profitable segments by geography and referral type.‚Äù
